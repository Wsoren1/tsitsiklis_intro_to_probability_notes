This differs from Statistics, since in Stats, there are many different methods to extract different answers, and there is no best method.  Choosing a method is described as an art, and considerations depend on factors such as performance guarantees, past experience, \"common sense,\" and the consensus of the statistics community. "

Bayesian statisticians will counter that a prior distribution would reflect our state of knowledge, as in, if we know from past experiments that there is a reasonable range for the mass of an electron, we can express this by postulating a prior distribution which is concentrated within that range.\n",
