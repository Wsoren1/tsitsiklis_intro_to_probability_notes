    "There are two main types, Bayesian and Classical.  \n",

    "Inference problems are normally categorized into Parameter Estimation, Hypothesis testing, and Significance Testing. The methodologies discussed in the textbook are Maximum a posteriori probability rule, least mean squares estimation, maximum likelihood, regression, and likelihood ratio tests."

We can then use methods to extract information, and have a set, unique \"correct answer.\"  This differs from Statistics, since in Stats, there are many different methods to extract different answers, and there is no \"best method.\"  Choosing a method is described as an art, and considerations depend on factors such as performance guarantees, past experience, \"common sense,\" and the consensus of the statistics community.
